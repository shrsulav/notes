Hello. I like to call myself an Embedded Software Engineer. I have done baremetal programming for different microcontroller and microprocessor platforms. I have tinkered with STM32F4-Discovery Board, SAME70-Xplained Board, Beaglebone Black, TI LaunchPad AM243x and ofcourse with Raspberry Pi and Arduino. During my embedded software adventures, I have had the opportunities to play around with Embedded Linux, Buildroot, Yocto, FreeRTOS, Azure RTOS (ThreadX).
